# self_improvement
Hi folks, here is some useful info about this repo:
What the project does? This is a deep learning repo, containing various deep learning projects. I will share the exact source and what part of the code is authored by me and otherwise for each sub-project. I will try to be generous with explanation and comments within the code to help you understand what is happening. 
Why the project is useful? Deep learning can be applied to any set of data which can be properly represented numerically. If you have natural science background, you know exactly what I mean (you may even have some nice ideas yourself, as I do!).
How users can get started with the project? Clone the repo first, make sure you read the comments and the documentations. Most importantly, do check out the amazing courses offered on www.udacity.com and www.coursera.org which would be mostly my source of inspiration. I will most certainly do my very best to add some value, and not just blindly make a useless copy of the work done by the amazing teaching these courses, of course.
Where users can get help with your project? Contact me on arian.seyedi@gmail.com, although I think you may not need it.
Who maintains and contributes to the project? Mainly I will be sole contributor, but any contribution/forking/etc is welcomed. Spread the passion and knowledge any way you can!

Hope you enjoy!
